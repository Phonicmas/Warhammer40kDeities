## Other
Make ideology meme that gives mood the more mutations a pawn has.

Make it possible to use different messages for each mental breakdown by adding a string field where you insert the language keyed that can then be used alongside .Translate() in code.

Other ways to trigger that the gods have shown interest. such a killing a lot of pawns then khorne notices, or researching a lot then tzeentch notices, banging a bunch the slaanesh or getting sick a lot then nurgle.

Make possibility to recieve gift scale of psy sens aswell


## Changes from last update
Rewritten, now every pawn has a new tab called ??? in which they can see how the gods view them, they can either be "Ignored", "Seen", "Acknowledged", "Favoured" or "Blessed"

Gaining favour for a god can done in the following ways:

Having a mental breakdown, gives you an amount, this amount if multiplied by some multiplier based on the mental breakdown kind, so Beserk will give more Khorne favour.
Offering at a ritual spot, just gives a flat amount for now.


Decreasing favour for a god can be done in the following ways:

Perform a purification ritual at an imperial shrine (or whatever this new building will be called)


While seen as "Ignored" you will not recieve any gifts from chaos at all.

At "Seen" or higher every 1.5 - 3 days you might be given a gift. The higher favour you have the better chance of it happening




Make mod settings for different things like deterioation amount, gift interval, purification and base ritual amount or multiplier?







Rework mod, make a new def type for the gifting which contains all the info about the gift

Make sure the favour comp can be attached to all kinds of humanlike pawn and make it able to be extended properly

Include more gift in the form of genes, traits and maybe weapons.

Maybe change the favour comp so that you select your god to focus on, so they gain 100% of favour gained frmo actions where the others maybe gain 25% or atleast reduced
The comp should then also show what the god dislikes and like on the current character

Make stat to influence favour gain, make as def.

Make a def for each god, that should contain fields for how much favour is gained when actively praying and when not.
