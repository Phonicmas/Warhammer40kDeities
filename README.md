## Other
Make ideology meme that gives mood the more mutations a pawn has.

Make it possible to use different messages for each mental breakdown by adding a string field where you insert the language keyed that can then be used alongside .Translate() in code.

Other ways to trigger that the gods have shown interest. such a killing a lot of pawns then khorne notices, or researching a lot then tzeentch notices, banging a bunch the slaanesh or getting sick a lot then nurgle.

Make possibility to recieve gift scale of psy sens aswell


## Changes from last update
Rewritten, now every pawn has a new tab called ??? in which they can see how the gods view them, they can either be "Ignored", "Seen", "Acknowledged", "Favoured" or "Blessed"

Gaining favour for a god can done in the following ways:

Having a mental breakdown, gives you an amount, this amount if multiplied by some multiplier based on the mental breakdown kind, so Beserk will give more Khorne favour.
Offering at a ritual spot, just gives a flat amount for now.


Decreasing favour for a god can be done in the following ways:

Perform a purification ritual at an imperial shrine (or whatever this new building will be called)


While seen as "Ignored" you will not recieve any gifts from chaos at all.

At "Seen" or higher every 1.5 - 3 days you might be given a gift. The higher favour you have the better chance of it happening




Make mod settings for different things like deterioation amount, gift interval, purification and base ritual amount or multiplier?
